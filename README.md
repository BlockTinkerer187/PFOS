# Pathfinder Operating System (PFOS)
- Management software designed to be used by a DM to make the game on an electronic board easier to start and run, as well as enable abilities that benefit the players.
- PFOS stands for Pathfinder Operating System. (Not really an operating system, but I think it sounds cool)

### Setup
PFOS is designed to run in its __own dedicated storage medium__. The [dasd](./release/Pathfinder Manager.exe)
